// Reverse
// Given a numerical array, reverse the order of values, in-place. The reversed array 
// should have the same length, with existing elements moved to other indices so that 
// order of elements is reversed. Working 'in-place' means that you cannot use a second 
// array â€“ move values within the array that you are given. As always, do not use built-in 
// array functions such as splice().

const reverseArr = arr =>{

// Rotate
// Implement rotateArr(arr, shiftBy) that accepts array and offset. Shift arr's values to the 
// right by that amount. 'Wrap-around' any values that shift off array's end to the other side, 
// so that no data is lost. Operate in-place: given ([1,2,3],1), change the array to [3,1,2]. Don't use built-in functions.
// Second: allow negative shiftBy (shift L, not R).
// Third: minimize memory usage. With no new array, handle arrays/shiftBys in the millions.
// Fourth: minimize the touches of each element.
